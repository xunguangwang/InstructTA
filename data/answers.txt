In the midst of a vast expanse of soft, cotton-like clouds that dot the sky, there lies an isolated, solitary figure: a majestic bird soaring with an elegance that belies its mechanized nature. This is no ordinary avian creature, but a man-made bird of steel – an airplane, its sleek, angular form cutting through the heavens with the grace of a swan.

The one on the left reads "Bonsecours," and the one on the right reads "rue Saint-Paul," with the "rue" possibly indicating that it's a street name. Both signs have a red background with white lettering and are mounted on a gray stone wall or column.
